daadde-exposed "Daddy Exposed" 
==============================
Daadde Exposed is a Sinatra\Grape\Mongoid joke app that provides you with a REST API to use the "German Academic Exchange Service" website. https://www.daad.de/en/index.html 

Why?
==============================
Because the daad.de website doesn't provide any official API!! so this application uses little nokogiri scraping magic to fetch the International Student's Programmes, store it in a mongodb instance and serve it back over a grape API just for your conveniance. 


Date
==============================
Mar 12, 2014, If the daad.de website changed its schema, the scraping technique obviously will need to be updated.


Last Words!
==============================
Have fun! :)
